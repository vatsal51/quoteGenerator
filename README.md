# Favourite Quotes WebApp

Welcome to the Favourite Quotes WebApp! This is a small web application where users can log in, generate random quotes, favorite them, unfavorite them, and even edit the text and author of a quote.

## Project Overview

This project is built using ReactJs and Axios for making API requests. It integrates with the API Ninjas service to fetch random quotes.

### User Stories

1. **User Authentication**: Users can log in using their credentials, and their login info is displayed on the top right corner. (Mock login data is used for now. Kindly use username as "baya" and password as "password".)

2. **Get Random Quote**: Users can click a button to get a random quote as many times as they want.

3. **Favorite Quote**: Users can favorite a random quote by clicking a button.

4. **Unfavorite Quote**: Users can unfavorite a previously favorited quote by clicking a button.

5. **Edit Quote**: Users can edit the text and author of a quote.

### Design and UI Components

For the UI design, custom CSS has been implemented.

## Installation and Setup

To run the app locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
4. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` to view the app.

## Deployment 

Although the application hasn't been deployed on a live service, it's currently hosted on Surge, offering a similar experience. You can access it here: [vatsal-quotes.surge.sh](vatsal-quotes.surge.sh). However, setting up a Continuous Deployment (CD) service is still pending. I need to conduct further research to efficiently set up a CD service.
